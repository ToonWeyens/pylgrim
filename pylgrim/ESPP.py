# Solve Elementary Shortest Path Problem without resource constraints.
# The algorithm is based on [1], but improved by the author.
# Features:
#   * single source / all targets
#   * no resources
#   * elementary paths are sought by requesting more and more paths for nodes which have been found to form part of a NCC (negative cost cycle), when there is no alternative.
#
# Note: The strategy in [1] is intrinsically flawed. Consider the following situation:
#   * Node 2 has a path 0->1->2.
#   * Node 3 has a path 0->3.
#   * A path from node 3 can be extended to node 2, say 0->3->2.
#   * If this path has lower cost than path 2, it replaces it.
#   * To find a path to node 3, now, by extending node 2, the only possible option is 0->3, in order not to have cycles.
#   * However, it is perfectly possible that 0->1->2->3 is better than 0->3, but 0->1->2 was thrown away.
#
# The solution to this problem is to keep more paths. The algorithm, however, then becomes very slow.
# It is therefore no advised to be used for anything but very small graphs.
